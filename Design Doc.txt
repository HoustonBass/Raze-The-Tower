Raze the Tower

You are an warrior who stumbles upon a forgotten tower
Noticing three statues (Melee, Ranger, Mage) outside the entrance, you decide to pick up the statue's sword and enter
(MVP, just melee is playable)

you enter the tower, there is a ladder, you can see the light fade around you as you approach it
Sheathing your sword, with a torch clenched in your teeth, you begin to climb

Level 1
You open a trap door at the top of the ladder, revealing an anvil, cracked in two
Noticing a door in the wall, you approach it
Hearing the screech of a goul, you burst in and slay it.
	He had a bigger friend, with some kind of glowing orb within him
Slaying him as well, you reach into its ectoplasm to retrieve the orb
	it begins to swirl around you, rythmicly 
Proceeding through another door, you see an empty room with another ladder
Upstairs you see another anvil, this time, it worbles at the same frequency as your following orb
	Placing the orb on the anvil, you land a mighty blow, cracking the orb and releasing some magic
		(Choose an upgrade)
Into the next room, another creature, another orb
	But in the following room, you are blindsided by a swift goblin.
		Except, instead of being run through, the orb quickly darts to intercept the goblin's blow
		Saving you but being destroyed in the process
Your goal is to reach the top of the tower, trying to defeat the final boss
	...before your torch runs out (5 minutes)
