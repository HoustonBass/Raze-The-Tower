One day, you happen upon a tower
deep in the forgotten forest

You feel the presence of a
powerful magic beckoning you to enter
----
Pride in your eyes,
and your heart set for glory

You kick past the mangled bones
of something far too large to be human
----
Pressing through the large oak doors,
you light your torch, and enter the darkness

You are met with a small simple room,
empty except a staircase
---
The magic is having some kind of effect on your torch
it wont last long

You know your time is waning
---
As you begin ascending the stairs,
you hear a voice...

"ASCEND...AND...MEET YOUR DOOM"
---


#Its time for this thing to meet its maker
#Something following you
#You are much smaller than your enemies
